# WIP

Every listed element exists and is perfectly useable, if not marked as WIP.\
The documentation itself is WIP.


# Elements overview

This tutorial gives you an overview over all the available SwiftGUI-elements.

Most of these elements can do much more than I show in this tutorial, so it pays off to read the corresponding element-tutorials.

# Widget-elements
This chapter covers all "non-combined" elements, which contain only a single tkinter-widget.

## Text
Aliases: T, Label

Displays a text. Nothing more, nothing less.

**Elements that have any text in them usually contain all options of this element**, so they are explained a bit more detailed.

## Button


## Checkbox
Aliases: Check, Checkbutton


## Frame
Aliases: Column


## Input
Aliases: In, Entry


## Separators (HorizontalSeparator, VerticalSeparator)
Aliases: HSep, VSep


## Spacer
Aliases: S

To be exact, this is an extended element, but it's so basic, let's keep it here.

## Listbox


## TKContainer
Aliases: TKWidget


## TextField
Aliases: Multiline


## Treeview (WIP)


## Table


## Notebook
Aliases: TabGroup


# Elements with extended functionality
SwiftGUI offers a couple of elements that contain a single tkinter-widget, but change its functionality.

## FileBrowseButton
A button that opens a file-dialogue when clicked.


## ColorChooserButton
A button that opens a color-chooser-menu when clicked.



# Combined elements
SwiftGUI offeres a couple of "combined" elements that consist of multiple SwiftGUI-elements.

## Form (WIP)
